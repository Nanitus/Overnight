Overnight - Global Game Jam Project

For the global game jam, my group created a game that added points to the player for every option they chose, depending on what their final point total was it would give the player an ending. Positive points resulted in a good ending, negative points resulted in a bad ending and 0 points resulted in a neutral ending. The game gives the player many options and aspects of the game change depending on what choices are made.
